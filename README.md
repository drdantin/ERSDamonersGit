This is a Front Controller Pattern application of a Employee Reimbursement System. To complete the applications functionality
I use on the front end, ajax, jquery,javascript, and JSON. On the Java Controller side I use a Buffered Reader to get the request
and use ObjectMapper for the response. For the Database communication, I use Callable,Prepared Statements, and Triggers. I want, after 
dealing with other priorities, set this up with Spring ORM JPA.
